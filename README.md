# PowerBI-Projects

The project focuses on developing a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) report using Power BI, structured around four key phases: data preparation, data modeling, report visualization, and final review and publication. Initially, we will import and clean an Excel dataset into Power Query, ensuring data integrity and preparing virtual tables. Next, we will establish relationships between tables and create necessary DAX measures and calculated columns to enrich the data model. In the visualization phase, we will design the report layout, incorporating various visuals and applying DAX measures with conditional formatting to highlight key insights. Finally, we will review the report for accuracy and usability before publishing it for end-users, facilitating data-driven decision-making for our fictional plant company.
